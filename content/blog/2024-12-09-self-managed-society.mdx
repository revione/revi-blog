In a model where communities take direct responsibility for politics, economy, and culture through participatory and deliberative processes, the approach is rooted in principles of cooperation, sustainability, and equity. Collective decision-making centers serve the needs and aspirations of the people.

The transition towards this society is achieved by creating local spaces for participation, such as community assemblies and economic cooperatives. Popular education and awareness-raising are key tools for fostering understanding, mobilization, and preparing individuals for active participation.

In this model, every individual is valued as part of an interdependent whole, where constant dialogue and collaboration generate inclusive solutions. The common good is reflected in building a collective life that prioritizes social well-being and harmony with nature.

Decisions are made in open assemblies through deliberation and consensus, addressing local needs and coordinating efforts with other communities. Solidarity economies protect and manage resources equitably, ensuring that economic decisions respond to collective needs.

This framework promotes harmony between people and their environment, offering opportunities for each individual to develop their potential while maintaining a balance between personal and collective interests.

How It Was Before.

With the advent of sedentary lifestyles, people began to settle in territories defined by natural features like rivers, mountains, or valleys. These characteristics influenced their perception of space, its extent, and its boundaries. However, these boundaries were not rigid but flexible and dependent on interactions with their surroundings and other groups.

Clans and tribes that inhabited a region for long periods developed notions of shared identity based on their cultural, spiritual, and economic relationships with the land. This sense of belonging defined what they considered their "homeland," though these ideas did not imply fixed or exclusive borders as we know them today.

Trade, cultural exchange, and linguistic communication flowed freely between neighboring groups, reinforcing cooperation and coexistence. For a long time, borders were fluid and adapted to the needs and dynamics of each community. These flexible interactions enabled coexistence based on mutual understanding.

What Is the Nation-State?

1. Origin of the Nation-State

The nation-state traces its roots back to the Industrial Revolution over 200 years ago, when traditional power structures evolved to accommodate new economic dynamics. The bourgeoisie, eager to influence political decisions, saw the state as a tool to consolidate their interests. Thus, the nation-state emerged as a centralized structure that facilitated capital accumulation and legitimized large-scale exploitation of human and natural resources. This model became the foundation for the development of monopolies in trade, industry, finance, and military power, marking the beginning of an era of centralized control in service of capitalism.

2. Key Characteristics of the Nation-State

The nation-state is characterized by its ability to centralize power and monopolize force, disarming society to consolidate its authority. Bureaucratic institutions not only manage resources but also uphold an ideological base that reinforces legitimacy. Furthermore, this model imposes a homogeneous national identity, using symbols such as flags and emblems to unify the population. At the same time, citizenship becomes a tool of assimilation, erasing local and cultural diversities in favor of an imposed uniformity.

Militarization is another essential feature of the nation-state, whose origin and expansion are closely tied to warfare. Since its inception, the nation-state has relied on military apparatuses to establish and perpetuate itself, linking civil governance to military control. This process uses national pride to justify the militarization of society. In its relationship with capitalism, the nation-state serves as an ideal vehicle for surplus accumulation, colonizing every aspect of social and economic life. Propaganda and financial incentives reinforce this dynamic, limiting individual and collective options under the guise of a common good that, in reality, serves monopolistic interests.

3. Social Impacts of the Nation-State

The nation-state has profoundly impacted society, particularly in perpetuating gender inequalities. Women have been exploited as cheap labor and reproductive resources, treated as commodities and sexual objects. This dynamic reinforces a patriarchal social structure that fuels sexism and ensures male dominance in all spheres. Through the repression of women, the social hierarchy that sustains the nation-state is strengthened, consolidating exploitation and domination as foundational pillars of its structure.

Ideologically, the nation-state defines citizens’ ethics and morality according to the interests of economic and political elites. Through social engineering, it promotes the idea of a shared destiny, while in reality perpetuating exploitation and reducing individual freedoms. Furthermore, the arts, sciences, and social consciousness are subordinated to corporate and state interests, limiting their independence and neutralizing disruptive potential. Modern science, for instance, is controlled by elites who decide which research receives support, excluding those that challenge the established system.

4. Hegemony of the Nation-State

The nation-state replicates dynamics of domination present in pre-state structures. In the past, when one tribe conquered another, it imposed its gods and beliefs on the defeated. Similarly, the nation-state culturally colonizes, imposing a single ideology that erases diversity and the autonomy of subjugated groups. This model relies on hegemony at all levels—economic, cultural, and military—to consolidate its authority. The accumulation of surplus, along with the elimination of decentralization, ensures that control remains in the hands of a few.

The orientation of the nation-state toward centralism is evident in its constant pursuit of monopolistic interests. Its ability to eliminate self-managed or decentralized alternatives reinforces its position as the most advanced and comprehensive monopoly. By reducing collective and individual freedoms, it limits societies' potential to develop autonomously and equitably.

5. Governance and Democracy in the Nation-State

The governance of the nation-state combines centralized administration with democratic participation, though its implementation varies across historical and cultural contexts. In many cases, positions of power are structured through political parties that organize and channel the popular will. However, the influence of economic and political elites in shaping these parties and their agendas can limit representativeness and responsiveness to citizens' demands.

Modern democracies often rely on direct elections, offering a space for citizen participation. This mechanism, though imperfect, allows people to choose their representatives and, in some cases, take part in fundamental decisions. However, the level of transparency and representativeness varies among states. Countries like Germany or Nordic nations, for instance, have developed systems that balance power centralization with high levels of citizen participation and a focus on social welfare. These democracies, though also influenced by prevailing economic and political structures, have maintained greater public trust in their institutions.

In other contexts, however, democratic processes may give the illusion of broader participation than actually exists. Fundamental laws and policies are often decided by those in top power positions, which can create a disconnect between the popular will and political decisions. This challenge highlights the need to strengthen transparency and inclusivity in nation-state democracies to ensure they genuinely represent the diversity of their citizens.

Solidarity Economy

The solidarity economy is grounded in collaboration and respect for collective needs, directing economic activities toward the well-being of people and the environment. Cooperatives, ethical banks, and local markets exemplify how economic relationships can be based on equity, sustainability, and democratic participation.

In cooperatives, participants are also owners, sharing responsibilities and benefits equitably. This model strengthens the sense of community and ensures that decisions meet the needs of those involved. Ethical banks channel resources into projects that benefit society and respect natural limits, avoiding excessive profit and promoting positive impact.

The Mondragón network in Spain illustrates how interconnected cooperatives can create a solidarity-based system that spans production to education, demonstrating that economies based on justice and participation are achievable.

These initiatives prioritize the equitable redistribution of resources while reinforcing community bonds and environmental care, offering a tangible alternative to the dominant economic model.

Transparency

Digital platforms provide key tools to facilitate assembly organization, ensure transparency in decision-making, and provide equitable access to knowledge. Their design and management are based on principles like open source, decentralization, and collective ownership, ensuring these technologies address the needs of communities rather than corporate interests.

These tools serve humanity by enabling clear, inclusive, and accessible communication. Instead of being used as instruments of control, they promote democratic participation and strengthen connections among individuals, fostering shared and responsible management of resources and information.

Self-Defense

Self-defense enhances physical integrity and promotes principles of equity and cooperation.

It is based on communities' capacity to organize and protect themselves autonomously on physical and strategic levels. This approach includes physical preparation, the development of community intelligence, and the formulation of strategies that ensure effective defense and security for themselves and those around them.

Training groups focus on strengthening physical skills and essential techniques for personal and collective protection. These practices build confidence and the ability to act as a team, fostering cohesive and resilient environments.

This paradigm incorporates mutual observation, integrating ideas and tools to recognize existing infrastructures and plan future steps that strengthen cohesion with other systems. This approach enables communities to identify power concentrations, design strategic solutions, and effectively respond to acts of oppression and abuse, thereby promoting a harmonious environment.

---

Education

Education is envisioned as a space for both personal and collective development, fostering discussion and clarification of diverse topics. These spaces enable critical observation and the adaptation of knowledge, promoting greater efficiency and clarity both internally and externally.

It is strengthened through participatory practices, including talks, conferences, group activities, and other dynamics that encourage learning. These activities reinforce cohesion and mutual understanding, creating an environment where ideas can be explored and applied collaboratively.

---

Heritage

Collective heritage encompasses the knowledge, history, and experience accumulated by communities over time. This legacy not only serves as a foundation for learning and revising practices but also guides new decisions for the benefit of people, establishing itself as a shared human patrimony.

Science, as an essential aspect of knowledge, helps us understand who we are across different scales and contexts, clarifying fundamental concepts for collective progress. This knowledge, accessible to all, encourages active participation in its development and documentation, ensuring that intellectual and cultural heritage continues to grow and adapt.

Challenges

Coordination Among Communities

While self-management is effective at the local level, integrating communities within larger systems can be complex. For confederations to be viable, clear and effective mechanisms are needed to resolve conflicts and make joint decisions while respecting each community's autonomy.

Democratic Awareness and Skills

A self-managed society requires high levels of critical awareness and skills for democratic participation. Transforming current mindsets and social habits demands time, continuous education, and spaces for collective learning. This shift is essential to ensure people can actively contribute to the self-managed model.

Recognizing Individualism

Valuing individualism is crucial to prevent apathy and encourage participation. Communities must respect each person’s time and capacities, creating an environment where individual contributions enhance collective well-being without imposing rigid or homogeneous dynamics.

Resistance from Traditional Structures

Traditional hierarchical structures and monopolistic interests pose significant barriers to the development of self-managed models. Moreover, consumerist and disposable capitalism threatens the preservation of natural resources and sustainability, exacerbating challenges for communities pursuing equitable alternatives.

Control of Self-Management Tools

Technological tools designed for self-management present risks if controlled by a few, replicating monopolistic dynamics. It is vital to ensure these tools are accessible, decentralized, and collectively managed, aligned with principles of equity and transparency.

Building International Networks

To counter resistance from monopolies and hierarchical structures, it is crucial to build international networks of support among self-managed movements. These networks facilitate the exchange of knowledge, resources, and solidarity, strengthening collective power to face external pressures and drive significant changes in social and economic systems.
