The material collected so far points to a consistent concept supported by scientific evidence and specific studies.

**Inner Core of the Earth**

The inner core of the Earth is composed primarily of iron and nickel with crystalline properties in its solid state.
The electromagnetic generation from the movements of the liquid outer core around the solid inner core produces Earth's magnetic field, which is essential for life as it protects us from cosmic radiation.

Studies such as those by Nassim Haramein explore the possibility of a cosmic energy network that connects all levels of reality.

The concept of an energetic toroid as a form of energy organization is widely recognized in science, from the magnetic structures of the Sun to Earth's electromagnetic field.
For example, the auroras, which result from the interaction between charged particles from the solar wind (protons and electrons) and Earth's magnetic field.
These particles are guided by magnetic field lines to the poles, where they collide with atoms and molecules in the atmosphere (such as oxygen and nitrogen), releasing energy in the form of light.
Energy enters the Earth via the solar wind and is directed to the poles through magnetic lines that form a toroidal structure.
During collisions in the ionosphere, part of this energy dissipates as light (auroras) and heat. Polar electric currents, known as "auroral electrojet currents," are also generated.
Their general shape aligns with the geometry of a toroid, especially in the outer magnetosphere where solar particles interact.
This model explains how lines of force bend from the magnetic North Pole to the South Pole, creating a continuous flow.

**Tunnels as Nodes in a Global System**

Underground tunnels could be viewed as energy nodes, particularly if strategically positioned in relation to:

Ley Lines: These hypothetical energy alignments are associated with points of high energy density on Earth's surface.
Active Geological Networks: Tectonic faults, volcanoes, or zones of high geological conductivity could connect with tunnels to form a dynamic system of energy flows.
Tunnels facilitate the transport of gases and particles (such as carbon dioxide, methane, and ions) between the atmosphere and the subsurface, creating a dynamic exchange of geothermal, chemical, and electromagnetic energy.
They enable energy conduits for electric charges in the air, such as those generated by thunderstorms or ionized solar wind flows, which could be channeled into the subsurface through electromagnetic phenomena.

Cavities and Underground Chambers: Natural cavities can resonate at specific frequencies and act as energy amplifiers.
Human Structures: Constructions such as pyramids, temples, and other ancient buildings are often aligned with geographic patterns and may be integrated into an energy system.
Ocean Currents: Though more related to kinetic and thermal energy, ocean currents could also influence global networks through their interaction with magnetic and geological fields.
Tunnels act as natural conduits for transporting heat and energy from Earth's interior to the surface.

Magma is an energy carrier that redistributes chemical and thermal elements between different layers of the planet as it moves.
Carbon dioxide and methane are gases released or absorbed in geothermal processes.
Ions and charged particles that interact with electromagnetic fields could contribute to an energy balance between the atmosphere and the subsurface.
Air is not merely empty space but a medium full of particles and energy. Elements present in the atmosphere, such as oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor, can exist in different energetic states.

Positive and Negative Ions in the Atmosphere influence biological and geological processes.
These states depend on factors such as:
Atmospheric Ionization: Phenomena such as cosmic radiation, lightning, and Earth's electromagnetic fields can ionize atoms and molecules in the air.
Earth acts as a giant capacitor, with electrons continuously flowing towards the core and surface.

Tunnels and Underground Cavities
Tunnels and underground cavities act as nodes in Earth's system, concentrating and redistributing energy at specific points.
Energy flows in a continuous cycle, moving matter and electric charges between the atmosphere and Earth's interior.
They also serve as conduits that distribute and modulate this energy, enabling continuous exchange with the surface.

It has been documented that underground cavities can amplify certain energetic frequencies, such as sound or electromagnetic waves.

Nikola Tesla worked with the concept of harnessing atmospheric energy and Earth resonance to generate free energy, aligning with the idea that Earth and its atmosphere are energetically connected.

Derinkuyu, other underground cities, and structures such as the Nazca Lines or ley lines function as energetic nodes for the exchange between the atmosphere and the subsurface.
